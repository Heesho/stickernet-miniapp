```

## Specific Design Pattern Requests

### Robinhood-Style Financial UI

```
Apply Robinhood's clean financial interface patterns to design:

1. A price display component with clear hierarchy
2. Trading action buttons with confirmation flows
3. Portfolio overview cards with data visualization
4. Real-time price update animations
5. Minimal notification system

Focus on: Clear data presentation, minimal chrome, high contrast CTAs
```

### Pinterest-Style Content Discovery

```
Implement Pinterest's visual discovery patterns for:

1. Masonry grid layout with dynamic heights
2. Image-focused content cards
3. Infinite scroll with seamless loading
4. Search and filter interface
5. Content detail modal/overlay

Focus on: Image optimization, smooth scrolling, visual hierarchy
```

### Mobile-First Navigation

```
Design a mobile-first navigation system with:

1. Bottom tab bar (5 items max)
2. Gesture-based interactions
3. Contextual app bars
4. Side drawer for secondary actions
5. Breadcrumb system for deep navigation

Focus on: Thumb-friendly design, clear visual hierarchy, smooth transitions
```

## Advanced Usage Examples

### 1. Component API Design

```
Using the component specifications from the UI/UX agent, help me design the API for an enhanced Card component that supports:

- Multiple variants (default, elevated, outlined, interactive, glass)
- Loading states with skeleton screens
- Hover interactions with micro-animations
- Click handlers with haptic feedback
- Accessibility props and ARIA support

Provide TypeScript interfaces and implementation guidance.
```

### 2. Animation System

```
Based on the micro-interaction guidelines, create an animation system that includes:

- Button state transitions (hover, active, loading)
- Page transition animations
- Loading state animations
- Gesture-based animations (swipe, pull-to-refresh)
- Performance-optimized implementations

Follow the timing and easing curves from the design system.
```

### 3. Responsive Breakpoint Strategy

```
Using mobile-first principles, design a responsive breakpoint strategy for:

- Typography scaling across devices
- Layout grid systems (masonry to standard grid)
- Navigation pattern changes
- Component size adaptations
- Touch vs hover interaction patterns

Consider the app's content-heavy nature and Pinterest-like layout needs.
```

## Integration with Development

### 1. Storybook Documentation

```
Help me create Storybook stories for the enhanced components using the UI/UX agent specifications:

- Component variants and states
- Interactive controls for testing
- Accessibility documentation
- Usage guidelines and examples
- Do's and don'ts sections
```

### 2. Testing Strategy

```
Design a comprehensive testing strategy for UI components based on the agent guidelines:

- Visual regression testing setup
- Accessibility testing automation
- Performance testing for mobile
- Cross-device compatibility testing
- User testing protocols
```

### 3. Implementation Roadmap

```
Create a phased implementation plan for upgrading existing components to match the UI/UX agent specifications:

Phase 1: Core components (Button, Card, Input)
Phase 2: Layout components (Grid, Navigation)
Phase 3: Advanced components (Modal, BottomSheet, Toast)
Phase 4: Animation and micro-interactions
Phase 5: Performance optimization and testing

Include effort estimates and dependency mapping.
```

## Best Practices for Agent Interaction

### 1. Be Specific
- Reference exact components or patterns you're working with
- Provide current code when asking for improvements
- Specify which design system aspects you want to focus on

### 2. Context Matters
- Mention your target users (mobile-first audience)
- Describe technical constraints (React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Reference existing brand guidelines or design decisions

### 3. Ask for Examples
- Request code implementations, not just descriptions
- Ask for before/after comparisons
- Request specific metrics or guidelines

### 4. Iterative Refinement
- Start with broad concepts, then drill down to specifics
- Ask follow-up questions about implementation details
- Request alternative approaches for comparison

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't Ask:
- "Make it look good" (too vague)
- Generic design advice without context
- Implementation without design rationale
- Copying designs without understanding principles

### Do Ask:
- "Apply Robinhood's button design patterns to improve touch interactions"
- "Optimize this Pinterest-style grid for mobile performance"
- "Enhance accessibility following the agent's WCAG guidelines"
- "Implement smooth micro-interactions for this trading interface"

## Measuring Success

Use these metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of your UI/UX improvements:

### User Experience Metrics:
- Touch target success rate (>95%)
- Navigation completion time
- User satisfaction scores
- Error recovery success

### Technical Metrics:
- Core Web Vitals scores
- Accessibility audit scores (WCAG AA)
- Performance budget compliance
- Cross-device compatibility

### Design System Metrics:
- Component reuse rate
- Design-to-development consistency
- Maintenance overhead reduction
- Team velocity improvement

Remember: The UI/UX Designer Expert subagent is optimized for mobile-first, accessible, and performance-focused design patterns.
