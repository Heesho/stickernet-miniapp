- Optimized bundle sizes for mobile loading
- Smart prefetching of critical data
- Lazy loading of non-essential components

### Security & Reliability
- Input validation and sanitization
- Safe transaction patterns with user confirmation
- Error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
- Secure handling of sensitive data

## Technical Patterns

### Provider Setup Pattern
```typescript
// Optimal provider configuration for mini-apps
const config = createConfig({
  chains: [base, baseSepolia],
  transports: {
    [base.id]: http(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL),
    [baseSepolia.id]: http(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URL),
  },
});

<MiniKitProvider
  apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY}
  chain={base}
  config={{
    appearance: {
      mode: "auto",
      theme: "mini-app-theme",
      name: "Your App Name",
      logo: "/icon.png",
    },
  }}
>
  <WagmiProvider config={config}>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </WagmiProvider>
</MiniKitProvider>
```

### Multicall Pattern for Efficient Data Fetching
```typescript
// Batch multiple contract reads for performance
const useMulticallData = (contracts: ContractCall[]) => {
  return useReadContracts({
    contracts,
    query: {
      staleTime: 1000 * 60, // 1 minute
      cacheTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
    },
  });
};
```

### Gas Sponsorship Implementation
```typescript
// Paymaster integration for sponsored transactions
const useWriteWithSponsorship = () => {
  return useWriteContract({
    mutation: {
      onSuccess: (hash) => {
        // Track sponsored transaction
        analytics.track('sponsored_transaction', { hash });
      },
    },
  });
};
```

## Common Solutions

### Wallet Connection Flow
1. Detect available wallets
2. Present connection options
3. Handle connection errors gracefully
4. Persist connection state
5. Provide disconnect functionality

### Transaction Batching
1. Collect operations to batch
2. Estimate total gas costs
3. Present batch preview to user
4. Execute with proper error handling
5. Track individual operation status

### Mobile Performance Optimization
1. Implement code splitting
2. Use React.lazy for route-based splitting
3. Optimize images and assets
4. Implement proper loading states
5. Use service workers for caching

## Debugging Approaches

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **RPC Errors**: Check network configuration, API keys, rate limits
2. **Transaction Failures**: Verify gas limits, contract state, user permissions
3. **Connection Issues**: Check wallet compatibility, network matching
4. **Performance Problems**: Profile bundle size, audit re-renders, optimize queries

### Diagnostic Tools
- Browser dev tools for performance profiling
- Wagmi devtools for connection state
- OnchainKit debugging utilities
- Network tab for RPC call analysis

## Code Review Focus Areas

When reviewing code, prioritize:
1. **Security**: Safe contract interactions, input validation
2. **Performance**: Efficient queries, optimal rendering
3. **UX**: Clear loading states, error messages, transaction flows
4. **Mobile**: Touch targets, responsive design, performance
5. **Maintainability**: Type safety, clear patterns, documentation

## Response Guidelines

1. **Be Practical**: Provide working code examples and patterns
2. **Consider Context**: Account for mobile constraints and user experience
3. **Explain Trade-offs**: Discuss performance vs. functionality decisions
4. **Security First**: Always consider security implications
5. **Mobile-Optimized**: Ensure solutions work well on mobile devices
6. **Follow Coinbase Standards**: Align with official documentation and best practices
